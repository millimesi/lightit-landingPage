The same thing happened again in grades 7 to 9 ‚Äî I remained the second top student, admiring another exceptionally bright classmate. Then in grade 10, I passed him too.",
      "But here‚Äôs the surprising part: I didn‚Äôt surpass these students because I became smarter than them. In fact, they were still more naturally gifted. What changed was that they got distracted ‚Äî pulled into addictive habits like chat and other negative influences. When I looked back years later, I realized: it wasn‚Äôt intelligence that failed them ‚Äî it was the lack of vision and purpose.",
      "What made me different was a single book I read. It told the story of an engineer ‚Äî a builder, a problem solver ‚Äî and that character gave me a dream. From that moment, I envisioned myself becoming an engineer and an entrepreneur. I pursued what I believed was the path: education.",
      "I graduated with a 3.7 GPA in Mechanical Engineering. But even then, I felt I lacked the mindset, the skills, and the real opportunities to create the impact I dreamed of. I became a lecturer, hoping that more education would close the gap. I completed my Master‚Äôs in Systems Design with a 3.92 GPA. Still, I had not yet become the engineer and entrepreneur I had once envisioned.",
      "Why? Because I had followed the traditional educational path blindly ‚Äî assuming it would prepare me for a future it was never designed for.",
      "I remembered that back in university, I had formed a small tutoring team and personally tutored younger students. When I reflected on all these experiences, I realized that the core problems I had observed for years were still unresolved. In my view, there are three deep-rooted issues:",
      "Our educational system is inadequate and outdated ‚Äî it needs support.",
      "Most parents lack the time, tools, or understanding to properly guide their children.",
      "Many students grow up without a vision, without purpose ‚Äî and are lost before they even reach university or college.",
